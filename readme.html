This is a work in progress, in which I'm trying to both build myself a new personal website/portfolio/blog, as well as learn how to use new things, such as Sass, Gulp, and more in-depth themeing on WordPress.

The theme work is being done in its own GitHub repo, thundernixon2015wp-sage. That's where the more-interesting work is happening.
